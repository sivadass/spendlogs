Since we only parse in this mode when parsing\n * the output of a serialize method this works, but it's not a general\n * solution.\n *\n * Unfortunately there is no general solution here because proto3 makes it\n * impossible to distinguish unset from explicitly set fields: both have the\n * default value for the type.

This owner lease is then verified inside every\n * transaction to ensure the lease has not been lost.\n *\n * If a tab opts not to acquire the owner lease (because there's an existing\n * non-expired owner) or loses the owner lease, IndexedDbPersistence enters a\n * failed state and all subsequent operations will automatically fail.\n *\n * The current owner regularly refreshes the owner lease with new timestamps to\n * prevent newly-opened tabs from taking over ownership.\n *\n * Additionally there is an optimization so that when a tab is closed, the owner\n * lease is released immediately (this is especially important to make sure that\n * a refreshed tab is able to immediately re-acquire the owner lease).\n * Unfortunately, IndexedDB cannot be reliably used in window.unload since it is\n * an asynchronous API. So in addition to attempting to give up the lease,\n * the owner writes its ownerId to a \"zombiedOwnerId\" entry in LocalStorage\n * which acts as an indicator that another tab should go ahead and take the\n * owner lease immediately regardless of the current lease timestamp.\n */\nvar IndexedDbPersistence = /** @class */ (function () {\n    function IndexedDbPersistence(prefix, serializer) {\n        this.ownerId = this.generateOwnerId();\n        this.dbName = prefix + IndexedDbPersistence.MAIN_DATABASE;\n        this.serializer = new LocalSerializer(serializer);\n        this.localStoragePrefix = prefix;\n    }\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.start = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        if (!IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable()) {\n            this.persistenceError = new FirestoreError(Code.UNIMPLEMENTED, UNSUPPORTED_PLATFORM_ERROR_MSG);\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\n        }\n        assert(!this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence double-started!');\n        this.started = true;\n        return SimpleDb.openOrCreate(this.dbName, SCHEMA_VERSION, createOrUpgradeDb)\n            .then(function (db) {\n            _this.simpleDb = db;\n        })\n            .then(function () { return _this.tryAcquireOwnerLease(); })\n            .then(function () {\n            _this.scheduleOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\n            _this.attachWindowUnloadHook();\n        });\n    };\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.shutdown = function () {\n        var _this = this;\n        assert(this.started, 'IndexedDbPersistence shutdown without start!');\n        this.started = false;\n        this.detachWindowUnloadHook();\n        this.stopOwnerLeaseRefreshes();\n        return this.releaseOwnerLease().then(function () {\n            _this.simpleDb.close();\n        });\n    };\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getMutationQueue = function (user) {\n        return IndexedDbMutationQueue.forUser(user, this.serializer);\n    };\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getQueryCache = function () {\n        return new IndexedDbQueryCache(this.serializer);\n    };\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.getRemoteDocumentCache = function () {\n        return new IndexedDbRemoteDocumentCache(this.serializer);\n    };\n    IndexedDbPersistence.prototype.runTransaction = function (action, operation) {\n        var _this = this;\n        if (this.persistenceError) {\n            return Promise.reject(this.persistenceError);\n        }\n        log.debug(LOG_TAG, 'Starting transaction:', action);\n        // Do all transactions as readwrite against all object stores, since we\n        // are the only reader/writer.\n        return this.simpleDb.runTransaction('readwrite', ALL_STORES, function (txn) {\n            // Verify that we still have the owner lease as part of every transaction.\n            return _this.ensureOwnerLease(txn).next(function () { return operation(txn); });\n        });\n    };\n    IndexedDbPersistence.isAvailable = function () {\n        return SimpleDb.isAvailable();\n    };\n    /**\n     * Generates a string used as a prefix when storing data in IndexedDB and\n     * LocalStorage.\n     */\n    IndexedDbPersistence.buildStoragePrefix = function (databaseInfo) {\n        // Use two different prefix formats:\n        //\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID . databaseID / ...\n        //   * firestore / persistenceKey / projectID / ...\n        //\n        // projectIDs are DNS-compatible names and cannot contain dots\n        // so there's no danger of collisions.\n        var database = databaseInfo.databaseId.projectId;\n        if (!databaseInfo.databaseId.isDefaultDatabase) {\n            database += '.' + databaseInfo.databaseId.database;\n        }\n        return 'firestore/' + databaseInfo.persistenceKey + '/' + database + '/';\n    };\n    /**\n     * Acquires the owner lease if there's no valid owner.
